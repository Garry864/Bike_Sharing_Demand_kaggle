This repository explores predicting hourly bike rental demand using a random forest regression model. It leverages data from the [Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) competition.

**Key Features:**

* **Predicts hourly bike rentals:** Train a random forest model to forecast the total count of bikes rented each hour based on historical data.
* **Leverages hourly data:** Utilize features like season, weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rental types (casual and registered) to capture temporal patterns.
* **Random forest model:** Employ a robust random forest regression model for accurate predictions.

**Getting Started**
